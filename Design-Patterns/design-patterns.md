# Design Patterns

## Introduction
- Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
- Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.
- Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
- Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation.
- Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton
- Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
- [Singleton Code](singleton.go)

### Factory
- Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- [Factory Code](factory.go)

### Abstract Factory
- Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- [Abstract Factory Code](abstract-factory.go)
